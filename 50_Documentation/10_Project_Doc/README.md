The place for your project documentation 

During the course you will have to create different documents about different sub-aspects of your work. Those documents are supposed to be increasing over time and will form the final documentation at the end.

* i.e., do not create a new document, but keep on extending your previous documents over time
* start doing the documentation using Latex from the very start
