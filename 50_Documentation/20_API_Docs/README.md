# API Documentation

This is the auto-generated documentations of our REA project.
We used [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
Change directory to [docs](https://git.informatik.uni-rostock.de/mmis/Teaching/2021WS/Projects/G3_Rule-Extraction_SB/-/tree/main/40_Realisation/99_Final_System/docs) and type `make html`. This will add the documentation of all files to the `docs/_build/html` folder.
In case you get an error like `cannot find system Renviron Fatal error: unable to open the base package` make sure that R is findable by setting the `R_HOME` environment variable (e.g. `export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R`).
